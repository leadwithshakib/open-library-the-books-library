The Email Service component of Open Library handles all email-related functionality. It's built with Node.js and provides a robust, scalable solution for sending emails across the application. The service integrates with Redis for job queuing and uses MailHog for email testing in development environments.

## Features

- Asynchronous email processing
- Email queue management with Redis
- Support for HTML and plain text emails
- Email templates
- Development environment testing with MailHog
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Email tracking and logging

## Setup

1. Navigate to the email-service directory:

```bash
cd email-service
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development service:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the server directory with the following variables:

```env
# Redis Configuration
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# SMTP Configuration
MAILHOG_SMTP_HOST=localhost
MAILHOG_SMTP_PORT=1025

```


## Development

### Testing with MailHog

MailHog provides a local SMTP server for testing emails. Access the MailHog web interface at:

```
http://localhost:8025
```


## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Emails not sending**

   - Check MAILHOG configuration
   - Verify Redis connection
   - Check email service logs

2. **Queue processing delays**
   - Monitor Redis memory usage
   - Check worker process status
   - Review error logs
